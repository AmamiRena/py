      <h1 style="font-size:20pt">COMP 1012 Lab 7</h1>
      <p><strong>June 25 to June 29, 2018</strong> </p>
      <h2>Material covered:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>function definition</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
        Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: Simple Function</h2>
        <p>
           In this program, you need to print your information in a function. The first line of your code will print your name.The second 
            line of your code should print your id and the third line of your code needs to print current date. For printing current date
            you can use the <span class="codeword">time</span> module. In <span class="codeword">time</span> module, there is a function
            called <span class="codeword">localtime</span>. You can use that function
        </p>
        <p class="todo">Declare a function with name <span class="codeword">printInformation</span>. The function does not have any arguments.</p>
        <p>Your output should look like following:</p>

      <h2>Exercise 2: Function with parameters</h2>
	  <p>Write a function that will take two values as its parameter and calculate the product of the two values. The result should be printed from 
        inside the function. So the function SHOULD NOT RETURN anything</p>
        

        <p class="todo">
            Declare a function with name <span class="codeword">multiplication</span> with two parameters a and b. The function definition should look 
            like this: <span class="codeword">def multiplication(a,b)</span>. Calculate the multiplication of a and b inside the function and also print 
            the result from inside the function. 
            
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 3: Function with parameters and return values</h2>
        <p>
            Write a function that will take two values as its parameter and calculate the product of the two values. The result should be printed from
            outside the function. So the function SHOULD RETURN the multiplication value between the numbers.
        </p>


        <p class="todo">
            Declare a function with name <span class="codeword">multiplication2</span> with two parameters a and b. The function definition should look
            like this: <span class="codeword">def multiplication2(a,b)</span>. Calculate the multiplication of a and b inside the function and return the
            value from where it is called. Save the returned value in a variable and print the value.

        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 4: Function that return multiple values</h2>
        <p>
            Write a function that will take a list as parameter and calculate the squared difference between each of the value in the list and mean of 
            the list. Return the squared difference list from where it is called. Print the squared difference list.
        </p>


        <p class="todo">
            declare a function with name <span class="codeword">findSquaredDiff</span> with one parameter. The parameter will take a list.
            You can consider this list: [5, 10, 100, 25, 200]. After passing this list as a parameter, you need to find the mean of this list
            and after finding the mean, you need to find the squared difference between each element from the list and the mean.
