        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.

        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

      <h2>Exercise 1: if elif .. else</h2>
        <p>
            Write a program to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Computer. Calculate percentage and grade according to following:<br />
            Percentage >= 90% : Grade A<br />
            Percentage >= 80% : Grade B<br />
            Percentage >= 70% : Grade C<br />
            Percentage >= 60% : Grade D<br />
            Percentage >= 40% : Grade E<br />
            Percentage < 40% : Grade F<br />
        </p>
        <p class="todo">
            Initialize an empty list for marks. Then use a <span class="codeword">for</span> loop to manipulate the list with 5 marks using 
            <span class="codeword">input</span> function inside the loop. When taking the input convert it to an int using 
            <span class="codeword">int()</span> function. after taking 5 inputs, you need to find the average. For finding the average
            you can use the <span class="codeword">sum</span> function and then devide it by the length of the list. Then you need to use 
            if elif ... else to find the grade. Atlast print the grade the student obtained.
            
        </p>
        <div class="output blue">
Enter 5 marks:

80

90

60

40

30
You get D
        </div>
        
      <h2>Exercise 2: while loop</h2>
	  <p>The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. Suppose,
        you have a list and the elements of the list are tuple. Each tuple contain two numbers. You need to find the GCD for each tuple. You can 
        consider this tuple: <span class="codeword">values = [(13, 3), (25, 5), (112,56), (232, 20)]</span>
        Now, write a program that will find the GCD of two numbers</p>
        <div class="output blue">
GCD of 13 and 3 is 1
GCD of 25 and 5 is 5
GCD of 112 and 56 is 56
GCD of 232 and 20 is 4
        </div>

        <p class="todo">
            You need to use a <span class="codeword">while</span> loop for this program as the main purpose of this program is to practice while loop.
            First, you need to access each tuple. For accessing each tuple, you need to use a for loop that will end upto the list length. And then you 
            can access number of each tuple using <span class="codeword">values[_i][0]</span> and <span class="codeword">values[_i][1]</span>. This
            will give you two numbers for the tuple at index _i. After getting those two numbers, you need to find the GCD using while loop.
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 4: Bubble sort</h2>
        <p>
            We can also compare strings to other strings. The comparison for
            strings is done numerically (by comparing the ASCII values of each letter).
            The strings are compared letter-by-letter, from left-to-right.
            The comparison continues as long as the characters from the two strings are
            identical; as soon as different characters are found, the string that has
            the character with the smaller ASCII code comes before the other string.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lists can be compared to other lists, and tuples to tuples.
            if you compare two lists/tuples in Python, they will be considered to
            be equal if both have the same number of elements, and
            each element of the first list is equal to the element at the
            same position in the second. If they have different lengths, the longer
            one is considered greater.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code below implements a very simple (but inefficient) algorithm called
            <em>bubble sort</em>. It sorts a list into ascending order. The algorithm
            works by comparing adjacent items in the list. If they are in the wrong
            order, swap them. At the end of the first iteration of the outer loop, the smallest
            item in the list has "bubbled" up to the front of the list. This process repeats
            for the second smallest, third smallest, etc. until the list is sorted.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
<span class="keyword">for</span> xx <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="builtin">range</span>(<span class="builtin">len</span>(values)-1):
    <span class="keyword">for</span> yy <span class="keyword">in</span> <span class="builtin">range</span>(xx+1, <span class="builtin">len</span>(values)):
        <span class="keyword">if</span> values[xx] > values[yy]:
                values[xx], values[yy] = values[yy], values[xx]
        </div>
        <p class="todo">
            Code the bubble sort, and try sorting the following lists. Try to predict the
            sorted order for the lists first.
            <div class="code">
valueList = ['Bill', 'billy', 'Doll', 'cold', 'Hot']
