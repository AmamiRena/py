      At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
      attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.

      It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
      for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
      explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
      Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
      know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
      the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
      the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
      lab will seem harder.

    <h2>Exercise 1: Generating 2D Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      Be sure to <span class="codeword">import numpy</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four ways we will generate 2D arrays from scratch, using the
      following four functions:
    </p>
      <div class="code"> 
<span class="numpy">np.random.random</span>(tuple)
<span class="numpy">np.zeros</span>(tuple) 
<span class="numpy">np.ones</span>(tuple) 
<span class="numpy">np.reshape</span>(vector, tuple)
      </div>
      <p>
        The function 
        <span class="codeword"><span class="numpy">np.zeros</span>(tuple)</span>
        creates a 2-D array of <span class="codeword">float</span>s with
        value <span class="codeword">0.0</span>, according to the dimensions in the tuple.
        In this lab, our tuples will be 2-tuples of integers, like (10,10).
        The functions <span class="codeword">np.ones</span> and 
        <span class="codeword">np.random.random</span> work in the same way.
      </p>
      <p> 
        We can also use <span class="codeword"><span class="numpy">np.reshape</span></span>. 
        Here, we provide a 1D array containing the elements, and it is reshaped into a
        2D array.
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        Try the following examples.
      </p>
      <div class="code blk">
x1 = <span class="numpy">np.random.random</span>((5,5))
x2 = <span class="numpy">np.zeros</span>((10,10),dtype=<span class="builtin">int</span>)
x3 = <span class="numpy">np.reshape</span>(<span class="numpy">np.arange</span>(1,13,dtype=int), (4,3))
      </div>
      

      <h2>Exercise 2: Indexing 2D Arrays</h2>

      <p>
        To index a 2D array, use a tuple with two integer indexes. For example, if 
        <span class="codeword">A</span> is a 3x5 array, then 
        <span class="codeword">A[2,4]</span> is a valid index for the array, but 
        <span class="codeword">A[4,2]</span> is not.  
        <span class="codeword">A.shape</span> will show the dimensions of any numpy array.
      </p>

      <p class="todo">
        Try the following examples.
      </p>
      <div class="code blk">
nums = <span class="numpy">np.reshape</span>(<span class="numpy">np.arange</span>(1,13,dtype=<span class="builtin">int</span>), (4,3))
<span class="builtin">print</span> (<span class="string">"nums:\n{0}"</span>.format(nums))    
<span class="builtin">print</span> (nums.shape)
<span class="builtin">print</span> ( nums[3,2])
<span class="builtin">print</span> (nums[2,3]) 
      </div>
 
      
      <h2>Exercise 3: Slices of 2D Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        2D <span class="codeword">Array</span>s can be sliced in the same way that
        <span class="codeword">array</span>s can, 
        except that both dimensions need to be specified.  
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        Try the following examples.
      </p>
      <div class="code">
nums = <span class="numpy">np.reshape</span>(<span class="numpy">np.arange</span>(1,13,dtype=<span class="builtin">int</span>), (4,3))
nums2 = nums[1:3,1:3]                       <span class="comment"># slice the array.</span>
nums[1:3,1:3] = <span class="numpy">np.zeros</span>(nums2.shape)       <span class="comment"># set to zero</span> 
      </div>
      <p>
        Slices can also include a single index, to slice a row or column from an array.
      </p>
      <p class="todo">
        Write a script file with a main method to produce the following arrays:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          a 5x5 2D <span class="codeword">array</span> of ints that
          contains 0s along all four boundaries, and 1s at all other
          positions. That is, an array that looks like this:

<div class="code">
[[ 0  0  0  0  0]
 [ 0  1  2  3  0]
 [ 0  4  5  6  0]
 [ 0  7  8  9  0]
 [ 0  0  0  0  0]]
</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          a 10x10 2D <span class="codeword">array</span> of ints where the entry at
          position i,j is i * j. That is,  an array like
<div class="code">
[[  1.   2.   3.   4.   5.   6.   7.   8.   9.  10.]
 [  2.   4.   6.   8.  10.  12.  14.  16.  18.  20.]
 [  3.   6.   9.  12.  15.  18.  21.  24.  27.  30.]
 [  4.   8.  12.  16.  20.  24.  28.  32.  36.  40.]
 [  5.  10.  15.  20.  25.  30.  35.  40.  45.  50.]
 [  6.  12.  18.  24.  30.  36.  42.  48.  54.  60.]
 [  7.  14.  21.  28.  35.  42.  49.  56.  63.  70.]
 [  8.  16.  24.  32.  40.  48.  56.  64.  72.  80.]
 [  9.  18.  27.  36.  45.  54.  63.  72.  81.  90.]
 [ 10.  20.  30.  40.  50.  60.  70.  80.  90. 100.]]
</div>

      </ul>
<p>
  For each of these arrays, you should construct them without the use of nested loops. 
  You will probably need one or more loops for constructing the lists. Do not use 
  np.array to construct the arrays. 
</p>


    </div>
      <h2>Exercise 4: Matrix Operations</h2>

<p>
  For all of the following questions, A and B are square matrices.  For each function, 
  test your method with parameters to verify if it is working.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    The determinant of a 2x2 matrix is A is given by
    <br />
    <img src="l9-2.jpg" />
    <br />
    Write a function <span class="codeword">det2</span> that takes a 2x2
    matrix and returns the determinant of the matrix.
    Use an <span class="codeword">if</span> statement to verify that the shape is
    the tuple <span class="codeword">(2, 2)</span>. If it is, return the determinant;
    otherwise return the python constant <span class="codeword">None</span>.
  </li>

  <li> 
    The determinant of a 3x3 matrix A is given by 
    <br/>
    <img src="l9-3.jpg" />
    <br />
    Write a function <span class="codeword">det3</span> that takes a
    matrix and returns the determinant if the matrix is a 3x3 matrix.
    Use <span class="codeword">det2</span> to compute your result. Again,
    use an if statement to verify that the shape of the matrix is (3, 3).
    If not, return <span class="codeword">None</span>. Hint: use
    slices, including steps, to get the three submatrices you need. You
    do not need loops.
  </li>

  <li>
    A and B are inverses of each other if A@B (the matrix product of A
    and B) is the identity matrix (the matrix with 1s along the main
    diagonal and 0s everywhere else). Write a function 
    <span class="codeword">areInverses</span> that takes two matrices and
    returns True only if the matrices are inverses of each other. Verify 
    that the matrices are square and have the same shape; if not, return
    <span class="codeword">None</span>.
    When comparing matrices, use the <span class="numpy">np.isclose</span>
    function. It compares the matrices element by element and produces a
    matrix of <span class="codeword">bool</span> values. Use a relative tolerance
    of 1e-10.  Create an identity matrix by using the <span
    class="codeword">np.eye(n)</span> function, which creates an identity matrix
    of size n.)
  </li>
</ul>
