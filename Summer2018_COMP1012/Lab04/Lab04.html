      <h2>Material covered:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>For loops</li>
          <li>Nested For loops</li>
          <li>if-else</li>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p> 
        All Python exercises are to be done using <span class="codeword">Anaconda
        Python</span> Integrated Development Environment.

        At some point during the lab, the demonstrator will circulate an
        attendance sheet. Sign it and pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is difficult to create a lab that will keep every student occupied
        for exactly 50 minutes. If you are finished early, use the time to
        explore other options in your programs, or to help others around you.
        Most learning takes place when you try to do something and you don't
        know how at first. If you do not finish in the time available, look at
        the rest of the lab at some other time before next week's lab. Remember,
        the learning is cumulative, so if you don't learn something, next week's
        lab will seem harder.

        You need to use nested for loop.First, you need to figure out how you are going to print spaces 
          and then you need to find how the numbers will be printed and where you need to stop for loop.

          If you complete the exercise 1, now try this one.

        <p>
            The first two fibonacci numbers The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. 
        </p>
        <p>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..</p>
        <p>Find the first 15 fibonacci numbers and print them:</p>
        
        <p class="todo">
            In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2.
            For example, the third number of the fibonacci series is 0 + 1 = 1 as the first two numbers are 0 and 1.
            The fourth number is 1 + 1 = 2 as the second and third number of fibonacci series is 1 and 1
